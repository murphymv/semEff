Description: This package provides functionality to automatically calculate 
    direct, indirect, and total effects from piecewise Structual Equation Models 
    (SEM), comprising lists of fitted models representing structured equations 
    (currently supported classes are "lm", "glm", "lmerMod", and "glmerMod"). 
    Confidence intervals for all effects are provided via bootstrapping.
