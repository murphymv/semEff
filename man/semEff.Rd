\arguments{
\item{sem}{A piecewise SEM, comprising a list of fitted model objects or of
boot objects (containing bootstrapped model effects). Alternatively, a
\code{"psem"} object from
\href{https://rdrr.io/cran/piecewiseSEM/man/psem.html}{\code{piecewiseSEM::psem()}}.
If list is unnamed, response variable names will be used.}

effects. If \code{NULL} (default), all predictors/mediators in the SEM will be
used.}

calculations (if present in \code{sem}).}

\item{ci.conf}{A numeric value specifying the confidence level for confidence
intervals on effects.}

\item{ci.type}{The type of confidence interval to return (defaults to \code{"bca"}
— see Details). See \code{\link[=boot.ci]{boot.ci()}} for further specification details.}

\item{digits}{The number of significant digits to return for numeric values
(for summary tables).}

excepting argument \code{index}.}

\value{
A list object of class \code{"semEff"} for which several methods and
extractor functions exist. Contains: 1. Summary tables of variables and
effects/CIs 2. All effects 3. All bootstrapped effects 4. All indirect
effects (individual, not summed)

\description{
Automatically calculate direct, indirect, total, and mediator
effects for endogenous (response) variables in a 'piecewise' structural
equation model (SEM).
}
\details{
The eponymous function of this package calculates all direct,
indirect, total, and mediator effects for a 'piecewise' structural equation
model (SEM), that is, one where parameter estimation is local rather than
global (Shipley 2000, 2009; Lefcheck 2016). The SEM simply takes the form
of a list of fitted models, or bootstrapped estimates from such models,
describing hypothesised causal pathways from predictors to response
('endogenous') variables. These are either direct, or operate indirectly
via other response variables ('mediators'). This list should represent a
directed ('acyclic') causal model, which should be named (exactly) for each
response variable and ordered from 'upstream' or 'causal' variables through
to 'downstream' (i.e. those at the end of the pathway). If \code{sem} is a list
of fitted models, effects will first be bootstrapped using \code{\link[=bootEff]{bootEff()}}
(this may take a while!).

Direct effects are calculated as fully standardised model coefficients for
each response variable, while indirect effects are the product of these
direct effects operating along causal pathways in the SEM. The total
effects of any given predictor on a response are then the sum of its direct
and (all) its indirect effects. 'Mediator' effects are also calculated, as
the sum of all indirect paths which operate through each individual
mediator — useful to assess the relative importance of different mediators
in affecting the response. All of these effect types can be calculated
automatically for all (default) or for a specified subset of predictors
and/or mediators in the SEM. As indirect, total, and mediator effects are
not directly bootstrapped using the fitted models for response variables
(i.e. via \code{\link[=bootEff]{bootEff()}}), their equivalent 'bootstrapped' estimates are
calculated instead using each bootstrapped direct effect.

Confidence intervals for all effects are returned in summary tables for
each response (see \code{\link[=bootCI]{bootCI()}}), with BC\emph{a} intervals calculated by default
using the bootstrapped estimates for each effect type (MacKinnon \emph{et al.}
2004, Cheung 2009, Hayes & Scharkow 2013). Effects for which the confidence
intervals do not contain zero are highlighted with a star (i.e.
'significant' at the \code{ci.conf} level). Bootstrap standard errors (standard
deviations of the samples) and biases (sample means minus original
estimates) are also included. Correlated errors (and confidence intervals)
are also returned if their bootstrapped values are present in \code{sem}, or if
they are specified to argument \code{cor.err} or as part of a \code{"psem"} object
(see \code{\link[=bootEff]{bootEff()}}). These represent residual relationships among response
variables, unaccounted for by the hypothesised SEM paths. Use \code{summary()}
for effect summary tables and \code{print()} to return a table of variable names
and associated details.

All calculated effects and bootstrapped effects are also returned in lists
for each response variable, with all except mediator effects also including
the model intercept(s) — required for prediction (these will be zero for
ordinary linear models with fully standardised effects). Effects can be
conveniently extracted with \code{\link[=dirEff]{dirEff()}}, \code{\link[=indEff]{indEff()}} and \code{\link[=totEff]{totEff()}}.

# Effects calculated using original SEM (models)
# (not typically recommended â€” better to use saved boot objects)
