\description{
Automatically calculate direct, indirect, total, and mediator
effects for endogenous (response) variables in a 'piecewise' structural
equation model (SEM).
}
\details{
The eponymous function of this package calculates all direct,
indirect, total, and mediator effects for a 'piecewise' structural equation
model (SEM), that is, one where parameter estimation is local rather than
global (Shipley 2000, 2009; Lefcheck 2016). The SEM simply takes the form
of a list of fitted models, or bootstrapped estimates from such models,
describing hypothesised causal pathways from predictors to response
('endogenous') variables. These are either direct, or operate indirectly
via other response variables ('mediators'). This list should represent a
directed ('acyclic') causal model, which should be named (exactly) for each
response variable and ordered from 'upstream' or 'causal' variables through
to 'downstream' (i.e. those at the end of the pathway). If \code{sem} is a list
of fitted models, effects will first be bootstrapped using \code{\link[=bootEff]{bootEff()}}
(this may take a while!).

Direct effects are calculated as fully standardised model coefficients for
each response variable, while indirect effects are the product of these
direct effects operating along causal pathways in the SEM. The total
effects of any given predictor on a response are then the sum of its direct
and (all) its indirect effects. 'Mediator' effects are also calculated, as
the sum of all indirect paths which operate through each individual
mediator — useful to assess the relative importance of different mediators
in affecting the response. All of these effect types are calculated
automatically for all (default) or a subset of predictors, mediators, or
response variables in the SEM. As indirect, total, and mediator effects are
not directly bootstrapped using the fitted models for response variables
(i.e. via \code{\link[=bootEff]{bootEff()}}), their equivalent 'bootstrapped' estimates are
calculated instead using each bootstrapped direct effect.

Confidence intervals for all effects are returned in summary tables for
each response (similarly to \code{\link[=bootCI]{bootCI()}}), with BC\emph{a} intervals calculated by
default using the bootstrapped estimates for each effect type (MacKinnon
\emph{et al.} 2004, Cheung 2009, Hayes & Scharkow 2013). Effects for which the
confidence intervals do not contain zero are highlighted with a star (i.e.
'significant' at the \code{ci.conf} level). Bootstrap standard errors (standard
deviations of the samples) and biases (sample means minus original
estimates) are also included for reference.

Correlated errors (and confidence intervals) are also returned if their
bootstrapped values are present in \code{sem}, or, if \code{sem} is a list of fitted
models, if specified to argument \code{cor.err} (see \code{\link[=bootEff]{bootEff()}}). These
represent residual relationships among response variables, unaccounted for
by the hypothesised SEM paths.

All calculated effects and bootstrapped effects are returned in lists for
each response variable, with all except mediator effects also including the
model intercept(s) — required for prediction (this will be zero for
ordinary linear models with fully standardised effects).

# SEM effects
(Shipley.SEM.Eff <- semEff(Shipley.SEM.Boot))

# Effects for selected variables
# semEff(Shipley.SEM.Boot, predictors = "lat")
# semEff(Shipley.SEM.Boot, mediators = "DD")
# semEff(Shipley.SEM.Boot, responses = "Live")

# Effects calculated using original SEM (models)
# (not typically recommended â€” better to use saved boot objects)
# system.time(
#  Shipley.SEM.Eff <- semEff(Shipley.SEM, R = 10000, seed = 53908,
