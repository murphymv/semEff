\title{Generalised Variance Inflation Factors}
\usage{
VIF(mod, data = NULL, env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A fitted model object, or a list or nested list of such objects.}

\item{data}{An optional dataset, used to first re-fit the model(s).}

\item{env}{Environment in which to look for model data (if none supplied).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the VIFs, or an array, list of vectors/arrays,
  or nested list.
}
\description{
Calculate generalised variance inflation factors for terms in a
  fitted model via the variance-covariance matrix of coefficients.
}
\details{
\code{VIF} calculates generalised variance inflation factors (GVIF)
  as described in Fox & Monette (1992), and also implemented in the
  \code{vif} function in the \pkg{car} package. However, whereas \code{vif}
  returns both GVIF and GVIF^(1/(2*Df)) values, \code{VIF} simply returns the
  squared result of the latter measure, which equals the standard VIF for
  single-coefficient terms and is the equivalent measure for
  multi-coefficient terms (e.g. categorical or polynomial). Also, while
  \code{vif} returns values per model term (i.e. predictor variable),
  \code{VIF} returns values per coefficient, meaning that the same VIF will
  be returned per coefficient for multi-coefficient terms. Finally, \code{NA}
  is returned for any terms which could not be estimated in the model (e.g.
  aliased).
}
\examples{
## Model with two correlated terms
m <- Shipley.Growth[[3]]
VIF(m)  # Date & DD somewhat correlated
VIF(update(m, . ~ . - DD))  # drop DD

## Model with different types of predictor (some multi-coefficient terms)
d <- data.frame(
  y = rnorm(100),
  x1 = rnorm(100),
  x2 = as.factor(rep(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), each = 25)),
  x3 = rep(1, 100)
)
m <- lm(y ~ poly(x1, 2) + x2 + x3, data = d)
VIF(m)
