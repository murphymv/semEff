bootSEM(sem, cor.err = NULL, data = NULL, ran.eff = NULL,
  R = 10000, seed = 1, catch.err = TRUE, parallel = "snow",

}
\arguments{
\item{sem}{A piecewise SEM, comprising a named list/nested list of fitted
model objects of class \code{lm}, \code{glm}, or \code{lmerMod}.}

\item{cor.err}{An optional character vector of the correlated errors in the
SEM. This should be of the form: \code{c("a ~~ b", "c ~~ d", ...)} (spaces
optional), with names corresponding to model names.}

\item{data}{An optional dataset used to first re-fit the model(s).}

\item{ran.eff}{For mixed models with nested random effects, the name of the
variable containing the highest-level random effect. If \code{NULL} and
\code{m} is a mixed model(s), crossed random effects will be assumed
instead.}

\item{R}{Integer, number of bootstrap replicates to generate.}

\item{seed}{Integer, seed for the random number generator (for reproducible
results).}

\item{catch.err}{Logical, should errors generated during model fitting or
estimation be caught and \code{NA} returned? If \code{FALSE}, any such
errors will cause the function to exit.}

\item{parallel}{The type of parallel processing to use. Can be one of
\code{"snow"}, \code{"multicore"}, or \code{"no"} (for none).}

\item{ncpus}{Integer, number of system cores to use for parallel processing.
If \code{NULL} (default), all available cores are used.}

\item{cl}{Optional cluster to use if \code{parallel = "snow"}. If \code{NULL}
(default), a local cluster is created using the specified number of cores.}

\item{bM.arg}{A named list of additional arguments to \code{bootMer}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to \code{stdCoeff}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{boot} containing the bootstrapped
  coefficients, or a list/nested list of such objects.
}
\description{
Generate bootstrapped standardised coefficients and correlated
  errors for a list of models, comprising a piecewise Structural Equation
  Model (SEM).
}
\details{
\code{BootSEM} uses the \code{boot} function (primarily) to
  bootstrap standardised coefficients from a fitted model or list of models
  (calculated using function \code{stdCoeff}), where bootstrapping is
  nonparametric, i.e. coefficients are calculated from data where the rows
  have been randomly sampled with replacement. The number of replicates is
  set by default to 10,000, which should ensure accurate coverage for
  confidence intervals under most scenarios.

  Where \code{weights} are specified, bootstrapped coefficients will be a
  weighted average across the set of candidate models for each response
  variable, calculated after each model is first refitted to the resampled
  dataset (specifying \code{weights = "equal"} will use a simple average
  instead). If no weights are specified and \code{sem} is a nested list of
  models, the function will throw an error, as it will be expecting weights
  for a presumed model averaging scenario. If the user wishes to override
  this behaviour and instead return a boot object of estimates for each
  individual model, they should recursively apply the function using
  \code{rMapply}.

  Where names of response variables with correlated errors are supplied to
  \code{cor.err}, the function will also return bootstrapped Pearson
  correlated errors (residuals) for the models fitting those variables
  (residuals used are the default type returned by \code{resid}). Where
  weights are supplied and \code{sem} is a nested list, errors are first
  averaged across candidate models (as for coefficients). If any two models
  (or candidate sets) with correlated errors were fit to different subsets of
  data observations, both models/sets are first refit to data containing only
  the common observations.

  For mixed models with nested random effects, the highest-level random
  effect (only) in the dataset is resampled, a procedure which best retains
  the hierarchical structure of the data (Davison & Hinkley 1997, Ren
  \emph{et al.} 2010). Lower-level groups or individual data rows are not
  themselves resampled, either within or across the higher groups. The name
  of the variable containing this random effect must be supplied to
  \code{ran.eff}. For non-nested ('crossed') random effects however (assumed
  when \code{ran.eff = NULL}), this form of resampling will not be
  appropriate, and (semi-)parametric bootstrapping is performed instead via
  \code{bootMer} in the \pkg{lme4} package. Users should think carefully
  about whether their random effects are truly nested or not (see
  \url{http://bit.ly/2K244jK}). NOTE: As \code{bootMer} takes only a fitted
  model as its first argument, any model averaging is calculated 'post-hoc'
  using the estimates in boot objects for each candidate model, rather than
  during the bootstrapping process itself (i.e. the default procedure using
  \code{boot} in \code{bootSEM}). Results are then returned in a new boot
  object for each response variable or correlated error estimate.

  Parallel processing is used by default via the \pkg{parallel} package and
  option \code{parallel = "snow"} (and is generally recommended), but users
  can specify the type of parallel processing to use, or none. If
  \code{parallel = "snow"}, a cluster of workers is created using
  \code{makeCluster}, and the user can specify the number of system cores to
  incorporate in the cluster (defaults to all available). \code{BootSEM} then
  exports all required objects and functions to this cluster using
  \code{clusterExport}, after performing a (rough) match of all objects and
  functions in the current global environment to those referenced in the
  model call(s). Users should attach any required packages prior to calling
  the function.

  NOTE: Bootstrapping mixed (or any other) models may take a very long time
  when the number of replicates, observations, parameters, and/or models is
  high. To decrease processing time, it may be worth trying different
  optimizers (e.g. \code{nloptwrap}) and/or other options to generate faster
  estimates (always check results).
