\title{semEff: Automatic Calculation of Effects for Piecewise Structural Equation Models}
\description{
Provides functionality to automatically calculate direct, indirect, 
    and total effects from piecewise structural equation models, comprising 
    lists of fitted models representing structured equations (Lefcheck 2016 
    <doi:10/f8s8rb>). Confidence intervals are provided via bootstrapping.
