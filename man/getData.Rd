\usage{
getData(mod, subset = FALSE, merge = FALSE, env = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A fitted model object, or a list or nested list of such objects.}

\item{subset}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, only observations used to fit the model(s)
are returned (i.e. missing observations (\code{NA}) or those with zero weight
are removed).}

\item{merge}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, and \code{mod} is a list or nested list, a single
dataset containing all variables used to fit models is returned (variables
must be the same length).}

\item{env}{Environment in which to look for data (passed to \code{\link[=eval]{eval()}}).
Defaults to the \code{\link[=formula]{formula()}} environment.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the variables used to fit the model(s), or a list or
nested list of same.
}
\description{
Extract the data used to fit a model.
}
\details{
This is a simple convenience function to return the data used to fit
a model, by evaluating the 'data' slot of the model call object. If the
'data' argument of the model call was not specified, or is not a data frame
(or coercible to such) containing all variables referenced in the model
formula, an error will be thrown â€” this restriction is largely to ensure
that a single coherent dataset of all model variables can be made available
for resampling purposes.

If \code{mod} is a list of models and \code{merge = TRUE}, all (unique) variables
used to fit models are merged into a single data frame. This will return an
error if \code{subset = TRUE} results in datasets with different numbers of
observations (rows).

\examples{
# Get data used to fit SEM from Shipley (2009)
head(getData(shipley.sem[[1]]))  # from single model
lapply(getData(shipley.sem), head)  # from SEM (list)
head(getData(shipley.sem, merge = TRUE))  # from SEM (single dataset)
